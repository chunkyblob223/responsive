                <p style="font-family: Geneva;">The purpose of this assignment is to take a poorly designed webpage or interface 
                    and redesign it using the skills we have learned so far. We will create low-fidelity
                    as well as high-fidelity prototypes and build a responsive website based on these
                    prototypes.

                <p style="font-size : 150%; font-family: Geneva;"><u>The Webpage I Chose</u></p>
                <p style="font-family: Geneva;">
                    I decided to choose the website of the company that I worked for over the summer:
                    California Junior Liferguard Programs, known as CAJG. I believe that this webpage could
                    use some updating to improve user navigation and to look more aesthetically pleasing.
                    Below is a screenshot of the front page of the CAJG website.
                </p>

                <a style="font-family:Gill Sans"; href="https://jrlifeguards.com">Here is the webpage</a>
                <p style="font-size : 150%; font-family: Geneva;"><u>Finding Problems</u></p>
                <p>
                    <ul style="font-family:Geneva">
                        <li>Webpage is inefficient; it uses many labels and is unorganized which makes it 
                            hard for the user to quickly find what they want
                        </li>
                        <li>It is confusing to try and register for the program; there is a lot of information
                            that makes it unclear as to what it is people have to do to register
                        </li>
                        <li>The different tabs are unclear as to what they mean, making the memorability less effective for the site</li>
                        <li>The learnability of the webpage is difficult, it takes a while to explore everything
                            that this company has to offer given the layout
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                </p>
                <p style="font-size : 150%; font-family: Geneva;"><u>Accessibility</u></p>
                <p style = "font-family: Geneva;">After using WebAIM WAVE to evaluate accessibility issues, I can agree with the issues
                    regarding color contrasts within the webpage. If there were someone who finds it hard
                    to differentiate between colors, this webpage would be hard to use for them. I also think
                    that there needs to be alternative text for the images on the webpage, which was pointed out
                    by WAVE. Overall, the lack of labels present was the largest issue in regards to accessibility.

            <p style = "font-family: Geneva;">Here are the high-idenlity prototypes for the mobile, tablet, and desktop version of the website (respectively).
                In terms of annotations, the mobile and tablet are very similar in terms of user-action. They are click based and so the links
                will be simply be clicked on which will then move you to a different page. For the desktop version, there will be a hover indication,
                in that the link will underline when you hover your mouse over it. As you can see, the structure of the website changes slightly as 
                you go from mobile, to tablet, to desktop.
